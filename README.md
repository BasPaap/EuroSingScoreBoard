# EuroSingScoreBoard
A eurovision-like scoreboard visualizer

Built for a real-life gaming experience based on the Eurovision Song Contest, this scoreboard application lets you collect every nation's votes and display them with striking visuals and animations.

See a sample video [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/BlMFjvzAbF6/).

Quick start guide:

1. Run the application and click the settings icon. Drag a number of jpeg images onto the window to add countries. The image will be used as the country's flag, the filename (without extension) will be used as the country's name, although this can be edited.
2. Select a country issuing votes, and enter the amount of points that country gives to other countries.
3. When all countries have issued votes, click "Show Results". A second window opens, showing an idle animation.
4. Select a country you wish to see the votes for and click the Next button.
5. The secondary window will show an animation for the country you selected, and will then show the leaderboard with the first seven votes issued by the selected country already filled in.
6. Keep clicking next to see the eight, ten, and twelve point votes. 
7. Select the next country (or just let the application select the next one) and click next again. The scoreboard will animate away, and the animation for the newly selected country will play.
8. When all countries have issued votes, the winning country will be displayed.

Tips: the secondary window can be dragged by clicking and dragging anywhere on its surface. Double click the window to toggle fullscreen mode.
